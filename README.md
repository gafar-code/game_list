# Flutter Coding Challenge : Game List App

The assignment is to build a mobile application to browse the latest released PlayStation 5 games, and view more details about said games. The application should display the latest released PlayStation 5 games in a ListView, GridView or whatever that is deemed useful by the candidate.<br>

The following information should be shown: Name, Release Date, Background Image, and Metacritic Score.
Pagination should be implemented so that when the user reaches the bottom of the list, the second page should be loaded if available. Additionally, the user should be able to view more details of a video game by tapping on it, which should include a Description, Genres, and (optional) any other details deemed useful or interesting for the user such as Screenshots, Other Platforms, Developers, and Publishers.
